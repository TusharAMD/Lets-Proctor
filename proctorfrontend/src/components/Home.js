<h3>What is Let's Proctor?</h3>
<p>
This Application is a complete solution for proctoring students during online exam.
Online Education has many benefits but one disadvantage is that during exam its difficult to supervise students.
So I made this app that is extremely simple to use even for people who are not well versed with technology. Also as we know that most of the teachers use Google form to conduct exam, that's why in this application too we will be asking user just a Google form link and rest all the things will be done by us. <br/>
